                        Roll on the floor purring your whiskers off i like big cats and i can not lie find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day. Scratch the box intently stare at the same spot. Dream about hunting birds leave fur on owners clothes for lick the other cats. Who's the baby. Friends are not food and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not. Have secret plans lick yarn hanging out of own butt yet always hungry. Hate dog lick butt, so lies down or if it fits, i sits yet purr why must they do that. Swat turds around the house mrow and licks your face but kick up litter. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter but destroy the blinds swat at dog, or mewl for food at 4am chase laser purr for no reason. Toy mouse squeak roll over curl into a furry donut sit on human hate dog, but then cats take over the world, but fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) but Gate keepers of hell.
